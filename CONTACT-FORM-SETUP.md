# Contact Form Setup

## Overview

We've set up a contact form system that allows users to send emails to arshia@r3al.ai directly from the website. This document provides an overview of the implementation.

## Components Created

1. **Contact Page**: 
   - Located at `app/contact/page.tsx`
   - Displays a form and contact information
   - Styled to match the rest of the website

2. **Contact Form Component**:
   - Located at `src/components/contact/ContactForm.tsx`
   - Handles form submission and validation
   - Provides feedback to users

3. **API Route**:
   - Located at `app/api/contact/route.ts`
   - Processes form submissions
   - Sends emails using nodemailer

4. **Email Testing Script**:
   - Located at `scripts/test-email.js`
   - Allows testing of email functionality
   - Run with `npm run test-email`

## Navigation Updates

1. **Navbar**:
   - Updated "Contact" link to point to the contact page
   - Changed "Get started" button to link to the contact page

2. **Main Page**:
   - Updated "Get started" and "Learn More" buttons to link to the contact page

3. **Get Started Section**:
   - Replaced email input with a direct link to the contact page

## Configuration

1. **Environment Variables**:
   - Created `.env.local` file for email credentials
   - Added to `.gitignore` to prevent committing sensitive information

2. **Dependencies**:
   - Added `nodemailer` for sending emails
   - Added `@types/nodemailer` for TypeScript support
   - Added `dotenv` for loading environment variables in the test script

## Setup Instructions

Detailed setup instructions are provided in the `README-EMAIL-SETUP.md` file, which includes:

1. How to create a Gmail App Password

## Next Steps

3. **Form Enhancements**: Consider adding additional fields or features to the contact form as needed.
4. **Analytics**: Add tracking to monitor form submissions and conversion rates.
